# bowling-scores-calculation

Just a demo of simple score calculator for bowling.

Test cases are to cover the functionality and prove if it works as expected.
The results were compared with those from https://www.bowlinggenius.com/

In Starter.main() there is a simple demo with two games. Most of the functionality can be checked with test cases 
in GameTest and FrameFactoryTest, respectively.
Since this is only a demo, I didn't spend much time on validations. 

Possible improvements:
* increase the number of test cases;
* add more validations;
* check results with a person, whi is aware of bowling rules.
